His progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Kongkrapunt Sangsuriya) is chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon-fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking, but when he befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.

I have such a personal connection with this movie, people telling you that you aren't good enough, but you learn to move on and accept yourself and not pretend to be something your not. Dreamworks had the chance to make Po, the main protagonist, a cocky know it all, but they made him meek and humble, and sort of a geek. And i'm so glad they did. But the score. .OH MY GOD, THE SCORE! Hans Zimmers has the ability to make you feel emotions, and for this movie, he cranks it up a notch, with certain scenes."</em></p></th>
